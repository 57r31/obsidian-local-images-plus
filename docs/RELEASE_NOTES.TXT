0.15.0
Fix: Unable to copy URI encoded file:// protocol links. 
     Now it is possible to use URI in file links. e.g. ')' as %29, '('  as %28 etc.
Fix: Asynchronous access to files.
Add: Assign paths for attachements in a more versatile way with temlpates (${date} and ${notename}). 
Add: Option to handle all new created (cloud-synced etc) markdown files.
Add: Canvas support.
Add: Option to process clipboard events.  

0.14.9
Fix: File naming algorithm might return the same name for similar images.
Add: Option to preserve original link captions.
     e.g. now ![anchor](http://link Caption) will be converted to ![[filename|Caption]]

0.14.8
- Fix: Internal code optimizations.
- Fix: GOT library was replaced to avoid CORS errors and hangs.
- Fix: Rolled back a change in the code made in 0.14.7 which leaded to unability to download images on some webpages.

0.14.6
- Fix: Regex issues and better parsing.

       For example the plugin now shows warning when some attachements were not downloaded due to errors (network, etc.).
       In this case a note content will be partially changed. 
- Add: The option "add **original filename**" was replaced with "add  [[original filename]]" as more useful in my opinion.
